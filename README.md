Deployment of Kubernetes with Kubeadm and Calico

The PDF file above has a complete (and I think easy) explanation on how to deploy a Kubernetes cluster (1 master node, 2 worker nodes) PROPERLY using the Calico CNI (I have seen all about the internet people getting the same error with BGP, but this tutorial explains how to fix the error, and indeed, the error is fixed in the calico.yaml file above).
